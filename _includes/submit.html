                <h2 id="submission-details">Submission Details</h2>

                <p>Submissions must be written in English, prepared using the new CEUR-ART 1-column style, formatted in PDF and
                submitted via <a href="https://easychair.org/my/welcome">EasyChair</a>.</p>

                <p>An Overleaf template for LaTeX users is available <a
                    href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwhxnqcghhdt">here</a>. Alternatively, you can <a
                    href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip">download</a> an offline version with the style files for both
                LaTeX and MS-Word.</p>

                <p>Auto-Mates 2023 invites submissions of research, industry and application contributions as well as software
                demonstrations.</p>

                <p>There are two paper submission formats:</p>

                <ul>
                <li><em>Regular papers</em> up to 14 pages (excluding references): must contain enough
                    substance that they can be cited in other publications and may not have appeared before.</li>
                <li><em>Extended Abstracts</em> up to 4 pages (including references): results and ideas
                    of interest to the Auto-Mates audience, including position papers, system and application descriptions and
                    presentations of preliminary results, overview of papers accepted at another conference or which you
                    submitted or plan to submit to another conference. In the latter case, extended abstracts must clearly state
                    the venue where the paper has been accepted or submitted alongside its status.</li>
                </ul>
              
                <p> Cool and exciting demos will be presented in a dedicated session at the workshop.
                    Submissions are via email <a href = "mailto: segev.shlomov1@ibm.com">SUBMIT</a>
                    The submission must include a link to a video of the demo and a text description of both the demo and the core ideas.
                    The submition deadline for the demos is June 2, 2023.

                </p>

                <p>All accepted papers are expected to be presented at the conference and <strong>at least one author of each
                    accepted paper <em>must</em> travel to the IJCAI venue in person. Multiple submissions of the same paper to
                    other IJCAI workshops are forbidden.</strong></p>

                <p>Submissions should be single blind so the names of the authors will be visible to the reviewers and should be
                indicated on the submitted files. In justified cases, if you wish your submission to be handled anonymously
                (i.e., double-blind) please send us an <a href="mailto:segev.shlomov1@ibm.com">e-mail</a> explaining the
                reasons. You will receive instructions on how to proceed.</p>

                <p>The proceedings will be submitted to CEUR-WS.org for online publication. Papers will be published under a CC
                BY 4.0 license that will be included in an open-access proceedings volume of CEUR Workshop Proceedings,
                indexed by both Scopus and DBLP. Extended Abstracts are no longer indexed by dblp.org and the case of an
                abstract of a pre-published paper may require a permission by the copyright holder.</p>
