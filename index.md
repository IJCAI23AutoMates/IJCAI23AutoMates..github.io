# The First International Workshop on the Future of No-Code Digital Apprentices

{: style="text-align: justify"} 
Semi-autonomous digital apprentices are a novel category of digital assistants or workers capable of making decisions and taking actions with a certain level of autonomy. These assistants rely on a combination of advanced technologies, including natural language processing (NLP), conversational AI, robotic process automation, digital process automation, and business rules to function effectively. However, integrating and developing these features can be a challenging task that requires the expertise of professional developers, leading to high lifecycle costs that limit their implementation to areas with clear returns on investment.

In recent years, AI has made significant strides in various domains, including transformers, large language models, general AI, multi-modal representations, and generative models such as ChatGPT, Codex, and Adept.AI. These advancements have led to remarkable progress in natural language processing, conversation, image recognition, code analysis, and digital interaction, which are poised to transform the field of digital assistants. With assistants becoming increasingly intelligent and better able to comprehend human work, they have the potential to assist human workers in a more extensive range of business tasks while also becoming more autonomous. This shift could lead to a significant increase in productivity and efficiency in the workplace.

To fully realize the benefits of these advancements, enterprises must ensure that end-users, who lack programming expertise, can effectively teach and supervise these assistants. This necessity has led to the development of no-code digital apprentices (NCDA), where humans serve as supervisors and machines as apprentices. The supervisor's role is to guide, validate, and teach the apprentice, who, in turn, must communicate its learning and identify when it is insufficiently trained for a task and seek guidance from the supervisor in such cases. NCDA places the focus on the necessary changes that need to take place in both AI technology and human factors to facilitate this kind of interaction. However, NCDA also presents a challenge: how to adapt modern AI techniques in the context of NCDA? Although transformer-based models and diffusion models receive much attention, both industry and academia have yet to fully understand the necessary changes in technology and the human-to-machine interface to enable the successful adoption of NCDA.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from various disciplines, including programming languages, natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge representation, planning, human-computer interaction, and business process management, to chart a cross-disciplinary research agenda that will guide future work in the field of NCDAs and the revolution that AI brings to it.

We welcome scientists, practitioners, and students, from academia and industry, who are passionate about the various directions in which AI may revolutionize the no-code automation field, to participate and to submit their original work. We welcome not only contributions that empower NCDA with AI algorithms, but also contributions that exploit their combination to solve more general problems in AI. The workshop also aims to attract people from research-oriented industrial divisions such as Microsoft Research, Google Research, IBM Research, Adept.ai, and intelligence automation vendors such as UiPath and Automation Anywhere.
