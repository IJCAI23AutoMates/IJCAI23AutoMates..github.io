# The first International Workshop on the Future of No-Code Digital Apprentices

{: style="text-align: justify"}
Semi-autonomous digital apprentices are a new type of digital assistant or digital worker that can make decisions and take actions with a certain degree of autonomy. Such assistants are implemented using a combination of natural language processing (NLP), conversational AI, robotic process automation, digital process automation, and business rules. The development and integration of all these functions can often present a challenge and require the expertise of professional developers. This in turn results in high lifecycle costs, limiting their implementation to areas with a clear return on investment.

Recent advancements in AI, specifically in the areas of transformers, large language models, general AI, multi-modal representations, and generative models (e.g., ChatGPT, Codex, and Adept.AI), have led to remarkable capabilities in natural language, conversation, image, code, and digital interaction AI tasks. These advancements are poised to revolutionize the field of digital assistants in the workplace. As assistants become smarter and better able to understand human work, they could potentially assist human workers in a much wider range of business tasks while also becoming more autonomous.

However, in order for enterprises to fully harness and adopt these advancements, end-users --- i.e., users who do not have programming background --- have to also be able to effectively teach  and supervise these assistants. 
This motivates the development of \textbf{no-code digital apprentices (NCDA)}, where humans are the supervisor and machines are the apprentices. 
The supervisor must guide, validate and teach the apprentice, who in turn must communicate its learning, be capable of identifying when it is not properly trained on some task, and seek guidance from the supervisor when exceptions occur. NCDA places the focus on key required changes that must take place in both the AI technology and human factors to facilitate this kind of interaction.
Furthermore, NCDA also brings in another challenge: how to adapt modern AI techniques in the context of NCDA? 
That is, while the underlying transformer-based models and diffusion models receive a lot of attention, less is understood in both industry and academia about the required changes in both technology and human-to-machine aspects to enable the successful adoption of NCDA.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from various disciplines, including programming languages, natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge representation, planning, human-computer interaction, and business process management, to chart a cross-disciplinary research agenda that will guide future work in the field of NCDAs and the revolution that AI brings to it.

{: style="text-align: justify"}
We welcome scientists, practitioners, and students, from academia and industry, who are passionate about the various directions in which AI may revolutionize the no-code automation field, to participate and to submit their original work. We welcome not only contributions that empower NCDA with AI algorithms, but also contributions that exploit their combination to solve more general problems in AI.


...Rsearchers from various communities, including AAAI, IUI, UIST, CHI ICSE, OOPSLA, ACL, EMNLP, ICLR, VL/HCC, and PLDI.
